<p>I decided recently that it might be a good idea to have a website. I didnâ€™t really know anything about how to make a website, or the technologies that are involved, but I did know how to use R Markdown. This was fortunate, as there is an R package called <strong>blogdown</strong> which allows you to create blogs and websites based on R Markdown documents.</p>
