>  "I love mornings, I just wish they came later in the day." 

When I was a child, I was given a bookmark bearing the quote above, next to a picture of a yawning tiger cub. Though the quote is not much more enlightening than 'Live, laugh, love', I remember it because it was true for me. Whenever I was awake early in the morning, I loved the smell of the air, the yellow light casting long shadows, the sense of stillness and quiet. But unfortunately for me, I have never been a morning person, and so experiencing this was quite a rare occasion. 

- the kraken wakes
- chronotype and health correlations
- misperceptions ie laziness, that it is a choice
- why I struggled
- how I am fixing it (inc nonphotic resetting)
